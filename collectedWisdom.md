# Collected Wisdom of Jason Crowther

## Abstract

## Kitchen

- Always make it look like your we were never there.  When you're done with your food prep, clean up enough so that the next person using the kitchen doesn't have do a clean up operation before beginning their own operation.
- Always clean hard to clean utensils like colanders, micro plane, and box graters immediately after you use them.  Its super easy to clean them before the food bits fuse to all the nooks and crannies in the device.
- Never pick up a hot cooking vessel without having a place ready for it to land.
- Always keep your pot holders and hot mitts in the drawer closest to the stove.
