# Collected Wisdom of Jason Crowther

## Abstract

## Kitchen

- Always make it look like you were never there.  When you're done with your food prep, clean up enough so that the next person using the kitchen doesn't have do a clean up operation before beginning their own preparations.
- Always clean the hard to clean utensils like colanders, micro plane and box graters immediately after you use them.  Its super easy to clean them before the food bits fuse to all the nooks and crannies in the device.
- Never pick up a hot cooking vessel without having a place ready for it to land.
- Always keep your pot holders and hot mitts in the drawer closest to the stove.

## Kids

- _Your kids are not little versions of you; they are little versions of themselves._ ([citation](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md?plain=1#L207))

## Running

- My favorite reasons for running:
  - It feels so damn good when I stop.
  - It calms the voices in my head.
